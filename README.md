# Steven Gregory's Card

It's me, Steven!

![Card](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stevengregory/stevengregory-card/master/card.png)

## Usage

Via npx:

```bash
npx @stevengregory/card
```

Not including how to use it globally because I'm not sure why you'd want this as a global command. That'd be creepy.
